# Movie Watchlist App

## About the Project
The Movie Watchlist App is a simple web-based tool that helps users keep track of movies they want to watch or have already watched. Users can log in, add movies, mark them as watched/unwatched, apply filters, and even rate them with stars — all with a clean and modern interface.

## Motivation
Too many people lose track of what they’ve watched or want to watch. This app was built to make it easier to organize your movie plans and avoid endless scrolling through Netflix trying to remember what you were gonna watch next.

## Installation
